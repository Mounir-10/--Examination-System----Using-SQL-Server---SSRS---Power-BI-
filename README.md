**I'm happy to share with you my graduation project from the Information Technology Institute's (ITI) Business Intelligence Track after a rewarding journey full of learning and labor.**

**The goal of the project is to create an examination system that enables students to take their exams which are randomized for each group of students then the system will correct and update their grades automatically. Additionally, use dashboards and reports to analyze this data.**

#### Here are the important points of the project:
>
> - Built a database from scratch for the ITI-Examination system using Microsoft SQL Server.
> - Developed an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram to model the database.
> - Collected and randomized data using Excel and Mockaroo.
> - Developed 90 stored procedures to ensure the system is functional.
> - Designed data models (Star Schema Model) using Power BI to analyze historical data for performance monitoring.
> - Developed interactive reports using SSRS.
> - Created 20 interactive Power BI dashboards

**The ITI examination system project is a thorough, well-organized project that offers a practical, cost-effective method for administering tests, keeping track of outcomes, and analyzing them.**
 #### The quarterly results look great!
>
